          <td class="bodyText"> <p>This is a 3D engine for DS. The objective of this is to make 3D more easily than   using libnds normal funcions. Of course, it uses libnds. You can load models and   textures from FAT (or EFS, or NitroFS..).</p>
            <p class="Estilo2">Examples</p>
            <p>You can get some compiled examples <a href="downloads/ne_examples.rar">here</a>. You should test them in real DS, some   effects don't work in emulators. </p>
            <p class="Estilo2">Instructions to include Nitro Engine</p>
            <p>1-Copy NitroEngine folder to devkitPro folder.<br />
              2-Compile it.   Nitro Engine should be ready.<br />
            3-Try to compile an example to   check if everything's working OK..</p>
            <p><span class="Estilo2">To do </span></p>
            <p>-More physics (bounding spheres, for example)..<br />
              -You an ask   me the things you would like to see in the engine.<br />
              -Tools for   linux. </p>
            <p class="Estilo2">Credits</p>

            <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="Estilo2">Changelog</p>
            <p><strong>1/9/2011 </strong>- Version 0.6.1. Fixed identation in all code. Now it isn't a pain to read it (not as much as before, :P). Also, a few warnings fixed (related to libnds new versions). </p>
            <p><strong>30/6/2009 </strong>-   Version 0.6.0.<br />
              -The functions used to modify textures and palettes now return a pointer to the data so that you can modify them easily.<br />
              -Each material can have different propierties (amient, diffuse...). You can set the default ones, the propierties each new material will have, and then you can set each material's propierties individually.<br />
              -New texture and palette allocation system, it is faster and better. Defragmenting functions don't work now, but I'll fix them for the next version.<br />
              -Added a debug system. You can compile Nitro Engine in &quot;debug mode&quot; and it will send error messages to the function you want. Once you have finished debugging or whatever, just recompile Nitro Engine without debug mode.<br />
              -Window system renamed to Sprite system. You can set a rotation and a scale for each one.<br />
              -The most important thing... The animation system has been improved, and now animated models are drawn using linear interpolation (you can disable it, anyway).<br />
              -As a result, I've modified the converters, so you'll have to convert yout animated models again.</p>
            <p><strong><strong>-</strong></strong><strong>28/1/2009 </strong>-   Version 0.5.1. Minor bugfixes.</p>
            <p><strong>-5/1/2009 </strong>- Version 0.5.0. Some   improvements.<br />
              -Text system and camera system optimized. New functions for the   camera system.<br />
              -NE_TextPrintBox and NE_TextPrintBoxFree slightly changed.   They can limit the text drawn to a number of characters set by the coder. <br />
              -Some functions made internal. Don't use them unless you know what you are   doing. <br />
              -Fixed (?) at least the 2D projection. <br />
              -HBL effects fixed. <br />
              -Touch test functions. <br />
              -NE_UPDATE_INPUT removed. <br />
              -It now supports   any BMP size, and BMP with 4 bits of depth.<br />
              -Arrays made pointers, so there   is more memory free when you are not using Nitro Engine. You can also configure   the number of objects of each systems you are going to use. <br />
              -NE_TextPalette   replaced by NE_Palette.<br />
              -You can clone materials to use the same texture with   different colors. This doesn't have the problems of cloning models. <br />
              -Added   functions to remove all palettes and textures. <br />
              -Fixed NE_End(). <br />
              -NE can   free all memory used by it, and the coder can tell NE how much memory to use. <br />
              -Texture drawing system improved a bit. <br />
              -NE_PolyFormat   simplified.<br />
              -Some bugfixes, code reorganized, define lists converted into   enums. <br />
              -Clear bitmap supported, this is used to display an bitmap as rear   plane. Each pixel can have different depth. This needs 2 VRAM banks to work. <br />
              -Solved some problems with 2D system and culling. <br />
              -Nomad   NDS_Texture_Converter is no longer included, if you want it, look for it in   google.<br />
              -Added Nitro Texture Converter, made by me. Open source, and it   exports various levels of alpha in the textures that can handle it. It does only   accept PNG files. <br />
              -NE now accepts any texture size. NE_SIZE_XXX defines   removed as they are not needed now. <br />
              -Added a couple of examples. </p>
            <p><strong>-14/12/2008 </strong>- Version 0.4.2. More   bugfixes...<br />
              -Fixed 2D system (textures were displaying wrong on 2D quads) and   text system (paletted textures sometimes were drawn without   palette).<br />
              -Compiled MD2_2_NEA, MD2_2_BIN and bin2nea to work in linux. Thanks   to nintendork32.<br />
              -Added a couple of examples. </p>
            <p><strong>-</strong><strong>12/12/2008 </strong>- Version 0.4.1.   Bugfixes time!<br />
              -LOTS OF BUGFIXES. Specially, UV coordinates swapping   fixed.<br />
              -Added a function to draw on RGBA textures ^_^.<br />
              -Fixed MD2_2_NEA   and MD2_2_BIN. You'll have to convert again your models.<br />
              -Updated to work   with latest libnds. There is a define in case you want to use an older version. </p>
            <p><strong>-15/10/2008 </strong>- Version 0.4.0. More   changes...:<br />
              -Added MD2_2_NEA &lt;converts an MD2 model into a NEA file that   can used by Nitro Engine&gt; and MD2_2_BIN &lt;Converts the first frame of an   MD2 model into a display list&gt;. Display lists created are really   optimized.<br />
              -Updated DisplayList_Fixer. Now it can remove normal commands   too.<br />
              -Added a text system. It can use fonts of any size. ^^<br />
              -Added some   simple API functions (buttons, check boxes, radio buttons and slide   bars).<br />
              -Fixed 2D projection.<br />
              -Removed some internal unused functions to   save space, and made 'inline' some of the rest.<br />
              -Functions that used float   parameters modified so they use integers now. You can still use some wrappers if   you want to use floats. This will let the compiler try to optimize the   code.<br />
              -Animated and static models are now the same. You can move, rotate, etc   them with the same functions.<br />
              -Now, you can 'clone' models so you can save a   lot of RAM if they are repeated.<br />
              -Renamed lots of model functions. Take a   look at new examples or documentation.<br />
              -NE_Color struct removed (I don't even   know why I created it...).<br />
              -Examples updated to work with last version and   added examples of clonning models, API and text system.<br />
              -libnds' console is   not inited with Nitro Engine. You will have to init it yourself with   NE_InitConsole or libnds' functions. </p>
            <p><strong>-16/</strong><strong>9/2008 </strong>- Version 0.3.0.   Lot of changes:<br />
              -Support for animated models (NEA format) and a program to   make a new NEA file from many models (in bin format).<br />
              -2D over 3D system. You   can draw easily quads (with or without texture) as if they were drawn using   2D.<br />
              -Basic physics engine (gravity, friction and collitions). It does only   support bounding boxes for now. <br />
              -Added a function to delete all models,   animated or not.<br />
              -Window system, very simple. I will make some API functions   in next versions. <br />
              -Nitro Engine compiled as a library to include it easier   in projects and save space. <br />
              -Examples folder organized a bit and added some   new examples. <br />
              -Nitro Engine is now licensed under the BSD license. </p>
            <p><strong>-31/8/2008</strong> - Released version 0.2.0. Added   effects like fog and shading, functions to load bmp files and convert them in   textures and more examples.</p>
            <p><strong>-24/8/2008</strong> - Released first version of Nitro   Engine (0.1). Includes 2 examples, documentation, tools to export models from   the PC, the license and full source. </p>
